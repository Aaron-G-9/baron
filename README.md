# Baron OS
###### A Rust based OS fit for nobility ;)

## About
This project isn't aiming to give the world a fully-featured daily driver (if you're 
looking for something like that, check out [Redox](https://github.com/redox-os/redox). 
Rather, this project aims to be a learning experience for contributors, both in operating
systems and in the Rust programming language itself.  
It should also be said that we're following the guide provided [here](https://os.phil-opp.com/)

## Contributors
[Aaron Goodfellow](https://github.com/Aaron-G-9/)
[Brandon Powell](https://github.com/bpowell)
(Bet you can't guess how we came up with the name...)

## Project State
Extremely early development
